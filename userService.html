<h1>Using our Services</h1>
</p>
<p>You must follow any policies made available to you within the Services.</p>

<p>Don't misuse our Services. For example, don't interfere with our Services or try to access them using a method other
    than the interface and the instructions that we provide. You may use our Services only as permitted by law,
    including applicable export and re-export control laws and regulations.</p>

<p>Using our Services does not give you ownership of any intellectual property rights in our Services or the content you
    access. You may not use content from our Services unless you obtain permission from its owner or are otherwise
    permitted by law. These terms do not grant you the right to use any branding or logos used in our Services. Don't
    remove, obscure, or alter any legal notices displayed in or along with our Services.</p>

<p>Our Services display some content that is not DZ Reader App. This content is the sole responsibility of the entity that
    makes it available.</p>

<p>In connection with your use of the Services, we may send you service announcements, administrative messages, and
    other information. You may opt out of some of those communications.</p>

<p>Some of our Services are available on mobile devices. Do not use such Services in a way that distracts you and
    prevents you from obeying traffic or safety laws.</p>

<p>Privacy and Copyright Protection</p>
<p>DZ Reader App's privacy policies explain how we treat your personal data and protect your privacy when you use our
    Services. By using our Services, you agree that DZ Reader App can use such data in accordance with our privacy
    policies.</p>

<p>Your Content in our Services</p>
<p>Some of our Services allow you to upload, submit, store, send or receive content. You retain ownership of any
    intellectual property rights that you hold in that content. In short, what belongs to you stays yours.</p>

<p>You can find more information about how we uses and stores content in the privacy policy or additional terms for
    particular Services. If you submit feedback or suggestions about our Services, we may use your feedback or
    suggestions without obligation to you</p>

<p>About Software in our Services</p>
<p>When a Service requires or includes downloadable software, this software may update automatically on your device once
    a new version or feature is available. Some Services may let you adjust your automatic update settings.</p>

<p>Open source software is important to us. Some software used in our Services may be offered under an open source
    license that we will make available to you. There may be provisions in the open source license that expressly
    override some of these terms.</p>

<p>Modifying and Terminating our Services</p>
<p>We are constantly changing and improving our Services. We may add or remove functionalities or features, and we may
    suspend or stop a Service altogether.</p>

<p>You can stop using our Services at any time, although we’ll be sorry to see you go. DZ Reader App may also stop
    providing Services to you, or add or create new limits to our Services at any time.</p>

<p>We believe that you own your data and preserving your access to such data is important. If we discontinue a Service,
    where reasonably possible, we will give you reasonable advance notice and a chance to get information out of that
    Service.</p>

<p>Our Warranties and Disclaimers</p>
<p>We provide our Services using a commercially reasonable level of skill and care and we hope that you will enjoy using
    them. But there are certain things that we don’t promise about our Services.</p>

<p>Other than as expressly set out in these terms or additional terms, neither DZ Reader App nor its suppliers or
    distributors make any specific promises about the Services. For example, we don’t make any commitments about the
    content within the Services, the specific functions of the Services, or their reliability, availability, or ability
    to meet your needs. We provide the Services “as is”.</p>

<p>Some jurisdictions provide for certain warranties, like the implied warranty of merchantability, fitness for a
    particular purpose and non-infringement. To the extent permitted by law, we exclude all warranties.</p>

<p>About these Terms</p>
<p>We may modify these terms or any additional terms that apply to a Service to, for example, reflect changes to the law
    or changes to our Services. You should look at the terms regularly. We’ll post notice of modifications to these
    terms on this page. We’ll post notice of modified additional terms in the applicable Service. Changes will not apply
    retroactively and will become effective no sooner than fourteen days after they are posted. However, changes
    addressing new functions for a Service or changes made for legal reasons will be effective immediately. If you do
    not agree to the modified terms for a Service, you should discontinue your use of that Service.</p>
